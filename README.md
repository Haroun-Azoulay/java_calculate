# <p align="center">Java_Calculate - Simple Calculator Application</p>

## Context
This is a simple Java project designed to introduce students to Java programming and basic syntax. The primary goal is to help learners get comfortable with Java 11 and the Eclipse IDE. The project emphasizes simple practices and clear coding standards to build a basic command-line calculator.

This project has been kept deliberately straightforward, focusing on user interaction and essential Java constructs such as loops, conditionals, methods, and exception handling. The application handles basic arithmetic operations.

## 📖 Subject
The calculator allows users to perform the following operations:

    Multiplication (*)
    Division (/)
    Addition (+)

The application workflow includes:

    Prompting the user to enter their username.
    Accepting two numbers for the calculation.
    Choosing an operation symbol (*, /, +).
    Returning the calculated result.

Key Focus Areas:

    Input validation
    Exception handling (e.g., division by zero)
    Method usage for modularity
    User-friendly interaction

## 📸 Screens
The project is a command-line application, so screenshots are not applicable. Example outputs are provided below:

Example Output:

```
Java Calculate
Enter your username:
> JohnDoe
Welcome JohnDoe!
Can you enter first number: 
> 10
Can you enter second number: 
> 2
Enter symbol to multiply (*) or divide (/) or addition (+):
> *
The result is: 20
```
